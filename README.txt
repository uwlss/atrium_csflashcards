--- Flashcards feature for Open Atrium ---

-- SUMMARY --

Flashcards help your group share and study key concepts and terminology.

Code: https://github.com/uwlss/atrium_csflashcards

-- INSTALLATION --

Install as usual, see http://drupal.org/node/70151 for further information.

-- KNOWN ISSUES --
I'm looking for help improving the CSS for the collapsible fields. Currently, the CSS overrides the vertical tabs CSS, adding a small triangle icon, even on edit forms. Part of the problem lies with issues with collapsible fields in the default theme for Open Atrium (see drupal.org/node/1027484). I'm very interested in a better approach to this!
